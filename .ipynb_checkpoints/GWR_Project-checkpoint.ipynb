    "The primary prupose of this project will be to initiate a geographically weighted regression (GWR) module following the development standards of PySAL. GWR is a local modeling technique that relies on computational statistic algorithms and is fundamentally geographic in nature. Important concepts include cross-validation/bandwidth selection techniques, spatial weighting/kernel functions, and localized diagnostics. To date, there are no open source python implementations that are available in a format conducive to automated workflows. This project seeks to fill that gap by providing base classes for GWR models, as well as the necessary utility functions for carrying out different types of bandwidth selections, various kernel weighting fucntions, and a simplified API for interacting with a GWR model. As a result, it should be possible to more easily carry out a GWR analysis using programmatic tools and to integrate it within a larger python framework. In addition, this porject will serve as a foundation for introducing new GWR variations and associated tools in python.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The project code will be house in [this repository](https://github.com/TaylorOshan/GIS596_GWR).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tentative plans\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refactor and clean existing python code written as desktop software.\n",
    "- Identify areas of overlap between existing PySAL codebase and existing GWR software (i.e., weighting functions).\n",
    "- Modify existing code to be harmonius with PySAL IO and data strcutures. \n",
    "- Write documentation for GWR classes and utility functions.\n",
    "- Optimize GWR code where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- GWR base class along with classes for a Gaussian, Poisson, and Logistic GWR.\n",
    "- Utility functions to carry out bandwidth selection, kernel weighting, and diagnostics.\n",
    "- Documentation and examples of usage."
